Brigham Young Universityâ€“Hawaii (BYU-Hawaii) is a private university in Laie, Hawaii. It is owned and operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). BYU-Hawaii was founded in 1955 as a satellite campus of Brigham Young University. In 2004, it was made a separate institution. The university's sole focus is on undergraduate education.

The university is broadly organized into four colleges, and its parent organization, the Church Educational System (CES), sponsors sister schools in Utah and Idaho. Approximately 97 percent of the university's 2,800 students are members of the LDS Church.[4] BYU-Hawaii students are required to follow an honor code, which requires behavior in line with LDS teachings (e.g., academic honesty, adherence to dress and grooming standards, and abstinence from extramarital sex and from the consumption of drugs and alcohol). A BYU-Hawaii education is less expensive than similar private universities since a large portion of tuition is funded by LDS Church tithing funds.[5]

The university partners with the LDS Church-owned Polynesian Cultural Center, the largest living museum in the State of Hawaii, which employs roughly one third of the student body.
